# Concurrency, Threading and Parallelism

## Figure


### Example 

- 4 cores -> 4 processes at the same time (parallelism)
- Each core runs at the same clock speed e.g 2.6 GHz

- A `thread` a set of program to be computed.
- Each thread is assigned one cpu core at time.

- Switching between the threads -> concurrency
