# Flask Babel Tutorial

- Flask-Babel is a Python library that provides internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n) support for Flask applications. It is built on top of the Python Babel and pytz modules, which provide the necessary functionality for handling dates, times, and locales.

- Flask-Babel allows you to add support for multiple languages and locales to your Flask application, making it easy to deploy your application globally and cater to a diverse audience. It provides a simple and intuitive API for translating messages, dates, and times, and also supports lazy translation loading, which can improve performance by only loading the necessary translations.

```bash
pip install flask_babel
```
