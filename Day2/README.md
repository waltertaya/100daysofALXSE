# Node.js vs Browser, Running Node.js Code

- In the browser, most of the time what you are doing is interacting with the the DOM, or other Web Platform APIs like Cookies. You don't have the document, window and all other objects that are provided by the browser.
- In the browser, we don't have all the nice APIs that Node.js provides through its modules. For example the filesystem access functionality.
- With Node.js, you control the environment.
- With Browser, you are at the mercy of what the users choose.
