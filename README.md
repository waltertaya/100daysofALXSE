# 100 Days of Node.js Coding Challenge

Welcome to the 100 Days of Node.js Coding Challenge! This repository is dedicated to your journey of mastering Node.js, the popular runtime environment for building server-side applications with JavaScript.

## About the Challenge

This challenge is designed to help you dive deep into Node.js and its ecosystem by providing a structured roadmap and daily tasks. Each day, you'll focus on a specific topic or concept related to Node.js, ranging from the fundamentals to advanced topics and real-world applications.

By committing to this 100-day challenge, you'll not only gain a solid understanding of Node.js but also develop practical skills through hands-on coding exercises and project-based learning.

## Getting Started

To begin the challenge, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the repository's directory.
3. Refer to the `100-days-plan.md` file for the daily topics and tasks.
4. Start with Day 1 and complete the tasks as outlined.
5. After completing each day's tasks, update the corresponding row in the `progress-tracker.md` file with the date and your signature.

## Challenge Structure

The challenge is divided into three main sections:

1. **Beginner Topics**: This section covers the fundamentals of Node.js, including an introduction, module systems, npm, error handling, and asynchronous programming.

2. **Intermediate Topics**: After solidifying the basics, you'll dive into more advanced concepts such as working with files, command-line apps, environment variables, taking input, printing output, working with APIs, HTTP servers, and keeping applications running.

3. **Advanced Topics**: In this section, you'll explore more complex topics like working with databases, templating engines, testing, logging, threads, streams, debugging, built-in modules, and building real-world projects.

## Resources

Throughout the challenge, you'll have access to various resources, such as:

- **Official Node.js Documentation**: The official Node.js documentation is an invaluable resource for understanding concepts, exploring built-in modules, and finding code examples.
- **Online Tutorials and Courses**: There are numerous online tutorials and courses available that can provide in-depth explanations, examples, and exercises to supplement your learning.
- **Open-Source Projects**: Exploring and contributing to open-source Node.js projects is an excellent way to learn from experienced developers and gain practical experience.

## Community and Support

Learning is more enjoyable and effective when done together. Throughout this challenge, you'll have the opportunity to connect with other participants, share your progress, and seek support when needed. Join the dedicated Discord server or follow the hashtag `#100DaysOfNodejs` on social media to engage with the community.
